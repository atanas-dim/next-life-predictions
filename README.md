# Next Life Predictions - Mixed messages generator
> This is a Codecademy JavaScript project, which prints a different combination of randomized messages everytime the programme is run!

## General info
Add more general information about project. What the purpose of the project is? Motivation?
The purpose of this project was to practice the knowledge on JavaScript synthax, arrays, objects, loops and functions.
To complete the task I've used :
* an __object__ to store __arrays__ of different types of messages,
* a __factory function__ to create a combination of randomized messages as a new array,
* separate __variable__ for each type of message I need to include in the prediction and use as arguments for the factory function,
* a __function to format__ the array of messages returned from the factory function

## Technologies
* JavaScript
