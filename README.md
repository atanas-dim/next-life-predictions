# Next Life Predictions - Mixed messages generator
This is a JavaScript project, which prints a different combination of randomized messages everytime a user runs the program.

## General info
The purpose of this project was to practice the knowledge of JavaScript synthax, arrays, objects, loops and functions.
To complete the task I've used:
* an __object__ to store __arrays__ of different types of messages
* a __factory function__ which returns an __object that has a method__ to create a combination of __randomized messages as a new array__
* separate __variables__ for each type of message I need to include in the prediction and __use as arguments for the factory function__
* another __function to format__ the array of messages returned from the factory function

## Technologies
* JavaScript
