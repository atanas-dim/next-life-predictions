# Next Life Predictions - Mixed messages generator
This is a JavaScript project, which prints a different combination of randomized messages everytime a user runs the program.

## General info
The purpose of this project was to practice the knowledge of JavaScript synthax, arrays, objects, loops and functions.
To complete the task I've focused on objects:
* an __object__ to store __arrays__ of different types of messages
* a __getter__ for each type of messages to return a random message
* an __object method__ to combine the randomly selected messages into a single one and print it

## Technologies
